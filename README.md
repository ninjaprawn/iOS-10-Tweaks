# iOS 10 Tweaks
Some basic iOS 10 tweaks. Currently compiled for the simulator, use https://medium.com/@theninjaprawn/simulator-injections-ios-10-9d11e4e3a388#.jvj8mxlia for injecting.

Tweaks:
- ItsActually64bit - Tweak to suppress the "Only compiled for 32bit" alerts when opening some apps
- ControlColors - Tweak to change the color of the CC toggles. Currently permenant colors until I can test the preference bundles on a device
- InternelToggles - Tweak to show the internel toggles. Currently PoC, so don't expect a beautiful CC when you open it.

Make sure you are using the latest version of theos/theos.
